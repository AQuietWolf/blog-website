                <p class="banner-description text-justify">Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications, encompassing a range of disciplines and technologies. It involves front-end development, which focuses on the visual aspects and user interactions of a site, using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, handles server-side logic, databases, and application integration, utilizing technologies such as Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js. Modern web development also includes responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices, accessibility considerations for inclusive use, and performance optimization for a seamless user experience. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Django streamline development, while deployment tools ensure smooth delivery to users. With the growing demand for online services, web development continues to evolve, integrating advanced concepts like progressive web apps, cloud computing, and AI-driven features.</p>

They can be broadly categorized into hard skills, such as technical or job-specific capabilities like programming, data analysis, or mathematics, and soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Skills are essential for personal growth and professional success, as they enable individuals to perform tasks effectively, adapt to new challenges, and achieve their goals.
